In this work, the physical processes responsible for the transport of particles in regular channels for turbulent flow regimes are modeled. Zero-equation RANS model was employed. Effects along the vertical direction (channel's depth) was neglected and the flow was assumed to be completely developed, allowing for a 1D approach. Particle transport was described by the BBO equation, through a Lagrangian approach, considering drag, lift, virtual mass and gravity as the forces which act on the particles. One-way coupling between flow and particles was considered, meaning that only the flow affected the particles, with no feedback from particles to the flow. Results for the flow profile showed good results and, although preliminary, results for the particle transport showed physical coherence, in accordance to the applied forces.
