The for materials with high mechanical performance has raised interest for the development of the advanced ceramics with severe applications, as Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Boron Carbide (B4C), for presenting great mechanical properties. Nevertheless, the porosity is still considered a limiting issue for the performance of such materials because, beyond certain limits, it reduces mechanical resistance. Its control is made by means of high cost techniques, computer tomography. The present study suggests a reconstruction technique for 3D optical microscopy images through Digital Image Processing of the material, which is previously polished in several depths, with controlled preparation parameters. The results from this methodology will be compared against tomography images for quantification of porosity, with the intent to validate the methodology.
