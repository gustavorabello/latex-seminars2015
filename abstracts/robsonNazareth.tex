A 2D two-phase DNS model has been developed in Ansys CFX. The governing equations are solved numerically via the finite-volume method. The volume fraction and interface were modeled employing the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method with a compressive differencing scheme and the surface tension force is modeled using the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) formulation. The model is used to investigate thermocapillary migration of bubbles in microchannels subject to temperature gradients using self-rewetting fluids. Self-rewetting liquids present a non-linear (parabolic) temperature dependence of surface tension that create a distinct bubble behaviour compared with pure liquids like water that has a linear dependence. Bubble dynamics using self-rewetting liquids in microchannels is the focus of this work and some preliminary results will be presented.
