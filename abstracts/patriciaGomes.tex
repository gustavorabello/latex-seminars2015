A three-field finite element scheme designed for solving systems of partial differential equations governing stationary incompressible flows is presented. It is based on the simulation of a time-dependent behavior. Once a classical time-discretization is performed, the resulting three-field system of equations allows for a stable approximation of velocity, pressure and extra stress tensor, by means of continuous piecewise linear finite elements, in both two and three-dimensional space. The main advantage of this formulation is the fact that it implicitly provides an algorithm for the iterative resolution of system non-linearities. We show that it can be employed with advantages, to the case of newtonian or quasi-newtonian fluids.
