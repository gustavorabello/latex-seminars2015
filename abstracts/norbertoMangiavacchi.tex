Natural phenomena like hydrodynamic instabilities, bucking of
structures, pattern formation in many physical systems, two-phase flows
with moving interfaces and waves, to name a few, produce interesting
shapes for their aesthetic impression and for their physical properties.
Looking at the artistic creations of Spanish Catalan architect Antoni
Gaud\'i i Cornet we recognize, as in a d\'ej\`a vu, some of these
geometric forms. His work, of personal and creative character, develops
from neo-Gothic and Oriental influences through Modernisme, into an
organic style inspired by natural forms. ``Everything comes from the
Great Book of Nature'' he had said. Examples of Gaud\'i architectural
creations, that illustrate his acute observation of nature, and the
genial combination of a positive aesthetic and emotional response with
very effective technical solutions in every detail will be presented,
showing their association to physical and mathematical principles.
