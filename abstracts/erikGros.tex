Numerical simulation is employed to simulate two-phase flow phenomena using the continuum method for surface tension modeling. The set of equations are based on the ’one-fluid’ Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) description of the Navier-Stokes equations. These equations are discretized by the Finite Element method on an unstructured mesh in which the phase boundary is represented by a set of interconnected elements that are part of the computational mesh, thus a sharp representation is successfully achieved. The presented modeling will then be used to investigate two-phase flows with moving contact lines, slug and annular flows in microchannels. These problems are of great interest for technology applications such as the cooling of microelectronic devices. The employed formulation, the interface representation, bubble-wall modeling and some initial results of this Ph.D. thesis will be presented for 2-dimensional Cartesian and axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates.
