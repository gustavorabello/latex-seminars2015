In the present work a new numerical method was developed for solving incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations (N-S) in transient regime with two-dimensional primitive variables which can be easily extended to three-dimensions. The methodology is based on Projection Methods and makes use of a mix approach through the Classical Integral Transform Technique (CITT). Since the main obstacle in the classical approach of pressure correction is the solution of Poisson's equation for pressure (PPE), this work proposes a different approach, using Classical Projection Method for time advance of N-S and CITT to find dependency of pressure over the discrete velocity field in a semi-analytical way, using pressure field from the previous time step as a filter. For comparison means, the Finite Volume Method was also employed, where PPE was solved by the Gauss-Seidel method. Two variations of the method were proposed: Simple Transform (CITT-ST) and Double-Transform (CITT-DT).
